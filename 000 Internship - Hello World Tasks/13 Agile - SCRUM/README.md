## Agile
![Agile Method](https://blog.neocoast.com/thumbs/the-agile-methodologies-101.png)

**Agile** means “incremental, allowing teams to develop projects in small increments. 

Agile is an **`iterative`** approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is a project management methodology that involves breaking down a project into smaller chunks and working on them in short cycles, known as **sprints.** 

Agile methodologies typically involve close collaboration between developers, product owners, and other stakeholders, with frequent communication and regular feedback.

## Scrum

**Scrum** is one of the most popular Agile frameworks for software development, and is focused on the iterative and incremental delivery of working software. 

![Agile Scrum Framework](https://planview-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/basics-and-benefits-of-agile-method1-1024x486.jpg)


The three core roles in Scrum are:

- **Product Owner:** Responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, which is the list of features or requirements that the development team will work on.

- **Development Team:** Responsible for designing, developing, testing, and delivering the product increments during the sprints.

- **Scrum Master:** Responsible for facilitating the Scrum events and ensuring that the team is following the Scrum process and values.


The three core artifacts in Scrum are:

- **Product Backlog:** A prioritized list of features or requirements that the team will work on during the sprints.

- **Sprint Backlog:** A list of tasks that the team will work on during the current sprint.

- **Increment:** The sum of all the completed product backlog items at the end of a sprint.

The five core events in Scrum are:

- **Sprint Planning:** A meeting where the team selects the tasks to be completed during the current sprint.

- **Daily Scrum:** A daily meeting where the team members report on their progress, discuss any obstacles, and plan their work for the day.

- **Sprint Review:** A meeting where the team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and receives feedback.

- **Sprint Retrospective:** A meeting where the team reflects on the previous sprint and identifies areas for improvement.

- **Backlog Refinement:** A meeting where the team and the product owner review and prioritize the product backlog.

## Scrum Master

Scrum Master is one of the three core roles in the Scrum framework, and is **responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process and values are understood and followed by the development team and the organization as a whole.** The Scrum Master is essentially the facilitator of the Scrum process, and works to ensure that the team is able to function effectively and efficiently.

Some of the key responsibilities of the Scrum Master include:

- **Facilitating the Scrum events:** The Scrum Master is responsible for organizing and facilitating the various Scrum events, such as the sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective meetings. The Scrum Master ensures that these events are productive and effective, and that they help the team to achieve their goals.

- **Removing impediments:** The Scrum Master works to remove any obstacles or impediments that may be preventing the team from achieving their goals. This may involve working with other stakeholders in the organization to resolve issues, or helping the team to develop solutions to problems.

- **Coaching and mentoring the team:** The Scrum Master works closely with the development team to ensure that they understand and are following the Scrum process and values. The Scrum Master may also provide coaching and mentoring to individual team members to help them improve their skills and performance.

- **Ensuring transparency:** The Scrum Master works to ensure that the development process is transparent and that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the team's progress and goals. This may involve providing regular status updates and progress reports, or facilitating communication between the team and other stakeholders.

## Sprint

Sprints are a key component of the Agile methodology, and refer to **short, timeboxed periods of development during which a specific set of tasks or features are planned, executed, and reviewed.** 

```diff
! Sprint mostly is about 4 weeks of less duration.
```

During each sprint, the development team focuses on completing a set of user stories or tasks that are identified in the product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features or requirements.

## Product Backlog
Product Backlog is an ordered list of requirements, features, and enhancements that make up the product roadmap.

Agile product backlog in Scrum is a **prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product.**  In general, each product in development should have a dedicated product backlog. Similarly, each product backlog should have a dedicated project team.

##  Standups

Standups, also known as **daily scrum meetings,** are a key event in the Scrum framework and Agile methodology. They are short, daily meetings where the development team comes together to provide status updates, discuss progress, and plan their work for the day.

During a standup, each team member typically answers three questions:

- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you planning to work on today?
- Are there any obstacles or impediments that are preventing you from making progress?

The standup is a **timeboxed meeting,** typically lasting between 15 and 30 minutes, and is intended to be a quick and efficient way for the team to stay aligned and focused on their goals. It is called a standup because team members are encouraged to stand during the meeting, which helps to keep the meeting short and focused.


## Timebox

Timebox is a predefined period of time during which a specific task or activity is performed. In Agile methodologies, timeboxing is a technique used to define and limit the duration of various events and activities, such as meetings, sprints, and development cycles.

### Initiatives

In Jira, an Initiative is a **high-level grouping of Epics** that are related to a specific goal or objective of a project or program. **Initiatives** are used to help organize work and provide a strategic view of progress towards larger business objectives.

An Initiative is typically larger in scope than an Epic and represents a broader strategic goal or objective. For example, if a company's goal is to improve their customer experience, they may have an Initiative called **"Improve Customer Experience."** This Initiative may include several Epics related to improving the website's usability, adding new features to the mobile app, and improving customer support.

![Epic](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a679339b-0098-4c88-acdb-7009b0de6efb/epics-vs-stories-agile-development.png?cdnVersion=973)


### Epic

Epics are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).


### Story

Stories, also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
