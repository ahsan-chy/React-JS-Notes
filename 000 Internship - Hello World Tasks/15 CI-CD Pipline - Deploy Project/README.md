### Development
A development environment in software and web development is a workspace for developers to make changes without breaking anything in a live environment.

Development is sometinge called **Alfa** env/ **Alfa** testings done here.

### Staging
A staging environment (stage) is **a nearly exact replica of a production environment for software testing.** Staging environments are made to test codes, builds, and updates to ensure quality under a production-like environment before application deployment.

We can say staging is **Beta version**/ Beta Env.

### Production
A production environment, sometimes called deployment environment, is the set of computers where finished, user-ready software is deployed and executed.
The live end-user-facing installation of a service, as opposed to a development or test environment

### Build 
Simply put, a software build is a set of executable code that is **ready for use by customers.** At end of every Sprint we release a Build.
